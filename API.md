## API Documentation

The sections below describe the public API of _npmlock2nix_.

## Functions

### node_modules

The `node_modules` function parses `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and generates a derivation containing a populated `node_modules` folder equivalent to the result of running `npm install`.
#### Arguments
The `node_modules` function takes an attribute set with the following attributes:

- **src** *(mandatory)*: Path to the source containing `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- **packageJson** *(default `src+"/package.json"`)*: Path to `package.json`
- **packageLockJson** *(default `src+"/package-lock.json")*: Path to `package-lock.json`
- **buildInputs** *(default `[]`)*: Additional build dependencies
- **githubSourceHashMap** *(default: `{}`)*: Dependency hashes for evaluation in restricted mode (See [Concepts](#concepts) for details).
- **preInstallLinks** *(default: `{}`)*: Map of symlinks to create inside npm dependencies in the `node_modules` output (See [Concepts](#concepts) for details).

#### Notes
- You may provide additional arguments accepted by `mkDerivation` all of which are going to be passed on.
- Sometimes the installation behavior of npm packages needs to be altered by setting environment variables. You may set environment variables by simply adding them to the attribute set: `FOO_HOME = ${pkgs.libfoo.dev}`.

### shell
The `shell` function creates a nix-shell environment with the `node_modules` folder for the given npm project provided in the local directory as either copy or symlink (as determined by `node_modules_mode`).

#### Arguments
The `shell` function takes an attribute set with the following attributes:

- **src** *(mandatory)*: Path to the source containing `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- **node_modules_mode** *(default `"symlink"`)*: Determines how the `node_modules` should be provided (See [Concepts](#concepts) for details).
- **buildInputs** *(default `[]`)*: Additional build dependencies that should be available in the shell.
- **node_modules_attrs** *(default `{}`)*: Overrides that will be passed to the `node_modules` function (See [Concepts](#concepts) for details).


#### Notes
- You may provide additional arguments accepted by `mkDerivation` all of which are going to be passed on.

---

### build
The `build` function creates a derivation for an arbitrary npm package by letting the user specify how to build and install it.

#### Arguments
The `shell` function takes an attribute set with the following attributes:

- **src** *(mandatory)*: Path to the source containing `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- **buildCommands** *(default `["npm run build"]`)*: List of commands to build the package.
- **installPhase** *(mandatory)*: Commands to install the package
- **node_modules_mode** *(default `"symlink"`)*: Determines how the `node_modules` should be provided (See [Concepts](#concepts) for details).
- **node_modules_attrs** *(default `{}`)*: Overrides that will be passed to the `node_modules` function (See [Concepts](#concepts) for details).

#### Notes
- You may provide additional arguments accepted by `mkDerivation` all of which are going to be passed on.

## Concepts

### githubSourceHashMap
When _npmlock2nix_ is used in restricted evaluation mode (hydra for example), `node_modules` needs to be provided with the revision and sha256 of all GitHub dependencies via `githubSourceHashMap`:

```nix
npmlock2nix.node_modules {
  src = ./.;
  githubSourceHashMap = {
    tmcw.leftpad.db1442a0556c2b133627ffebf455a78a1ced64b9 = "1zyy1nxbby4wcl30rc8fsis1c3f7nafavnwd3qi4bg0x00gxjdnh";
  };
}
```

Please refer to [github-dependency](https://github.com/tweag/npmlock2nix/blob/master/tests/examples-projects/github-dependency/default.nix) for a fully working example.

### preInstallLinks

Sometimes you may want to augment or populate vendored dependencies in npm packages because they either aren't working or they cannot be fetched during the build phase. This can be achieved by passing a `preInstallLinks` attribute set to `node_modules`.

If you wanted to patch the [cwebp-bin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cwebp-bin) package to contain the `cwebp` binary from nixpkgs under `vendor/cwebp-bin` you would do so as follows:

```nix
npmlock2nix.node_modules {
  src = ./.;
  preInstallLinks = {
    "cwebp-bin" = {
      "vendor/cweb-bin" = "${pkgs.libwebp}/bin/cwebp"
    };
  };
}
```

Please refer to [bin-wrapped-dep](https://github.com/tweag/npmlock2nix/blob/master/tests/examples-projects/bin-wrapped-dep/shell.nix) for a fully working example.


### node_modules_mode

_npmlock2nix_ can provide the `node_modules` folder to builds and development environment environments in two different ways as designated by `node_modules_mode`:

- `copy`: The `node_modules/` folder is copied from the nix store
- `symlink` The `node_modules/` folder is symlinked from the nix store

The first can be useful if you are also using `npm` to interactively update or modify your `node_modules` alongside nix based builds.

**Note**: If you are entering a shell environment using `npmlock2nix.shell` and there is an existing `node_modules/` _directory_ (instead of a symlink), `npmlock2nix` will print a warning but will not touch this directory. Symlinks on the other hand will be updated.

### node_modules_attrs

When you actually want to describe a shell environment or a build, but you need to pass attributes to `node_modules` you can do so by passing them via `node_modules_attrs` in both `build` and `shell`:

```nix
npmlock2nix.build {
  src = ./.;
  node_modules_attrs = {
    buildInputs = [ pkgs.zlib ];
  };
}
```
