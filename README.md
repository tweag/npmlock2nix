  <p align="center">
    Simple and unit tested solution to nixify npm based packages.
  </p>
</p>

## About

_npmlock2nix_ is a Nix based library that parses the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files in order to provide different outputs:

1. A `shell` environment
1. A `node_modules` derivation
1. A custom `build` derivation

### Features

- No auto-generated code :heavy_check_mark:
- Works in restricted evaluation :heavy_check_mark:
- GitHub dependencies :heavy_check_mark:
- Unit Tests :heavy_check_mark:
- Integration Tests :heavy_check_mark:

## Getting Started

Since `npmlock2nix` is written entirely in Nix, there aren't any additional prerequisites, it just needs to be imported into your project.

### Installation

The preferred way to provide _npmlock2nix_ to your project is via [niv][niv-url]:

```shell
$ niv add Tweag/npmlock2nix
```

Assuming you are also tracking nixpkgs via niv, you can then provide _npmlock2nix_ to your project as a [nixpkgs overlay][overlay-link]

```nix
# nix/default.nix
let
  sources = import ./sources.nix;
in
  import sources.nixpkgs {
    overlays = [
      (self: super: {
        npmlock2nix = pkgs.callPackage sources.npmlock2nix { };
      })
    ];
  }
```

Assuming the setup above, you can import `nix/default.nix` which will yield a nixpkgs set containing _npmlock2nix_.

## Usage

The following sections outline the main use-case scenarios of _npmlock2nix_.

**Note**: All examples only reflect the most basic scenarios and mandatory arguments. For more details please refer to the [API documentation][api-url].

**Note**: All code snippets provided below assume that _npmlock2nix_ has been imported and is inn scope and that there are valid `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files in the project root.

### Providing A Shell

```nix
npmlock2nix.shell {
  src = ./.;
}
```
The `shell` function creates an environment with the `node_modules` installed that can be used for development purposes.

Please refer to the [API documentation][api-url] for additional information on `shell`.


### Building `node_modules`

```nix
npmlock2nix.node_modules {
  src = ./.;
}
```
The `node_modules` function creates a derivation containing the equivalent of running `npm install` in an impure environment.

Please refer to the [API documentation][api-url] for additional information on `node_modules`.


### Building A Project

```nix
npmlock2nix.build {
  src = ./.;
  installPhase = "cp -r dist $out";
  buildCommands = [ "npm run build" ];
}
```
The `build` function can be used to package arbitrary npm based projects. In order for this to work,
_npmlock2nix_ must be told how to build the project (`buildCommands`) and how to install it (`installPhase`).

Please refer to the [API documentation][api-url] for additional information on `build`.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome in the form of GitHub Issues or PRs. Please consider the following before creating PRs:

- This project uses nixpkgs-fmt for formatting the Nix code. You can use `nix-shell --run "nixpkgs-fmt ."` to format everything.
- If you are planning to make any considerable changes, you should first present your plans in a GitHub issue so it can be discussed
- _npmlock2nix_ is developed with a strong emphasis on testing. Please consider providing tests along with your contributions and don't hesitate to ask for support.

## Development

When working on _npmlock2nix_ it's highly recommended to use [direnv][direnv-url] and the project's `shell.nix` which provides:

- A commit hook for code formatting via [nix-pre-commit-hooks][nix-pre-commit-hooks-url].
- A `test-runner` script that watches the source tree and runs the unit tests on changes.

The integration tests can be executed via `nix-build -A tests.integration-tests`.
